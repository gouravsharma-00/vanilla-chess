## 🚀 About the Project  

**Vanilla-Chess** started with a simple question: *what if chess wasn’t just about memorizing moves and playing the same openings over and over?*  

Classic chess is brilliant, but it often rewards **pattern-based learning**—players rely on established strategies and pre-learned tricks. While that’s impressive, it sometimes leaves little room for raw, spontaneous creativity.  

That’s where **Vanilla-Chess with Superpowers** comes in 🎉.  

The rules of traditional chess are still here, but with a twist:  
- **🛡️ Shield** – Protect your piece for one turn  
- **🔄 Skip** – Make your opponent lose a turn, UNO-style  
- **💥 Nuke** – Wipe out that pesky pawn   

These power-ups break the monotony of predictable play and throw players into **real-time problem-solving mode**. Suddenly, strategy isn’t just about the “best known move,” it’s about adapting to chaos, thinking creatively, and making the most of unpredictable situations.  

👉 And that’s the main goal of this project: to shift players away from pattern-based thinking and towards **creative, adaptive, and fun problem-solving**.  

In short: it’s chess, but with explosions, surprises, and way more laughs.
