## 🚀 About the Project  

Vanilla-Chess started as a simple idea: *make chess fun, fresh, and exciting* 🎉.  
Classic chess can be intense and strategic, but what if we added a bit of chaos? That’s where **power-ups** come in.  

✨ **Features:**  
- 👥 **Human vs Human** – play with a friend (on the same device).  
- ⚡ **Power-Ups Mode** – activate special abilities that can turn the tide of the game.  
- 🎨 **Clean & Minimal UI** – a modern chessboard design.  
- ✅ **Rules Enforced** – turn-based play, legal moves, and captures.  
- 🔮 **Creative Gameplay** – because chess should be *brainy and fun*!  

🛠 **How it’s built:**  
- 🏗 **HTML** – board structure, controls, and layout.  
- 🎨 **CSS** – styling, animations, and chess piece design.  
- ⚡ **JavaScript (ES6+)** – move validation, turn management, power-up logic, and gameplay flow.
