## 🚀 About the Project

Vanilla-Chess is my submission for the **🌱 CodeSprout Hackathon – August 2025 Edition**.  
The challenge was to build something fun using **only vanilla web technologies** — no frameworks, just raw HTML, CSS, and JS.  

**What it does:**  
- Lets you play chess with another human (on the same device).  
- Offers a mode to play against **Stockfish**, a world-class open-source chess engine.  
- Renders a clean, minimal chessboard UI.  
- Enforces legal moves, turn-based play, and piece captures.  

**How I built it:**  
- **HTML** for structure (chessboard, controls, and layout).  
- **CSS** for styling the board, pieces, and animations.  
- **JavaScript** for all the game logic — move validation, turn switching, Stockfish integration, and gameplay flow.
